## 🏭 Production Checklist (Required)
- Set `APP_ENV=production` and `APP_DEBUG=false`.
- Run `php artisan key:generate` once (if empty key).
- Run `php artisan migrate --force`.
- Run `php artisan config:cache && php artisan route:cache && php artisan view:cache`.
- Ensure writable folders: `storage/` and `bootstrap/cache/`.
- Create storage link: `php artisan storage:link`.
- Configure queue driver (`database` or `redis`) and run queue worker.
- Configure cron scheduler (every minute):

```bash
* * * * * php /home/your-user/your-app/artisan schedule:run >/dev/null 2>&1
```

## 💳 Payment Configuration
- Stripe: `STRIPE_SECRET`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- PayPal: `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`, `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`, `PAYPAL_MODE`, `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID`
- Cron secret (optional internal maintenance use): `CRON_SECRET`

### Webhook Security (Provider-Native)
- Stripe webhooks are verified using the `Stripe-Signature` header and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
- PayPal webhooks are verified by calling PayPal's `verify-webhook-signature` API using `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID`.
- Endpoint: `POST /webhooks/payments/{gateway}` where `{gateway}` is `stripe` or `paypal`.

## 🔐 Security Baseline
- Keep `.env` outside public exposure and never commit secrets.
- Use HTTPS in production and set secure session cookies.
- Configure webhook endpoints and secrets before enabling checkout.
- Restrict file upload permissions and monitor `storage/logs/laravel.log`.

## 🧪 Validation Commands
```bash
npm run build
php artisan test
```
